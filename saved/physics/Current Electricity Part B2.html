    Sure! Here's a draft of a Physics textbook chapter on Current Electricity: EMF, Terminal Voltage (TV), and Internal Resistance (IR) for ICSE Class 10, aligned with curriculum expectations:

Chapter: Current Electricity – EMF, Terminal Voltage, and Internal Resistance
Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

Define electromotive force (EMF) and terminal voltage.

Understand the concept of internal resistance in a cell.

Derive and use the relationship between EMF, terminal voltage, and internal resistance.

Solve numerical problems related to EMF, TV, and IR.

1. Introduction to Electric Current

Electric current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor. In metallic conductors like copper wires, current is carried by electrons.

Unit of current: Ampere (A)

Symbol: 
𝐼
I

Current direction: From positive to negative terminal (conventional current)

2. Electromotive Force (EMF)
Definition:

The electromotive force (EMF) of a cell is the total energy supplied by the cell per unit charge in driving the charge around the complete circuit, including the internal parts of the cell.

EMF
=
Total energy supplied
Total charge
EMF=Total chargeTotal energy supplied​
Symbol and Unit:

Symbol: 
𝐸
E

Unit: Volt (V)

Important Notes:

EMF is the maximum potential difference between the terminals of a cell when no current is drawn (i.e., in open circuit).

It is not a force despite the name.

3. Internal Resistance (IR)
Definition:

Every cell or battery offers some opposition to the flow of current within itself. This opposition is called internal resistance of the cell.

Symbol: 
𝑟
r

Unit: Ohm (Ω)

Key Points:

Caused by the resistance of the electrolyte and other internal components.

Generally, small but not negligible.

Becomes important when high currents are drawn.

4. Terminal Voltage (TV)
Definition:

Terminal voltage is the potential difference across the terminals of a cell when it is supplying current.

Symbol: 
𝑉
V

Unit: Volt (V)

Relationship Between EMF, Terminal Voltage, and Internal Resistance:

When a current 
𝐼
I flows through a cell of EMF 
𝐸
E and internal resistance 
𝑟
r, the terminal voltage 
𝑉
V is given by:

𝑉
=
𝐸
−
𝐼
𝑟
V=E−Ir

Where:

𝐸
E: EMF of the cell

𝐼
I: Current in the circuit

𝑟
r: Internal resistance

𝐼
𝑟
Ir: Voltage drop across the internal resistance

5. Special Cases
Case 1: No current drawn (Open circuit)

𝐼
=
0
I=0

𝑉
=
𝐸
V=E

Case 2: Cell in use (Closed circuit)

𝐼
>
0
I>0

𝑉
<
𝐸
V<E

7. Example Problems
Example 1:

A cell has an EMF of 2.0 V and internal resistance of 0.5 Ω. If the external resistance is 3.5 Ω, find:

(i) The current in the circuit
(ii) The terminal voltage

Solution:

V=E−Ir=2.0−(0.5)(0.5)=2.0−0.25=1.75V
Example 2:

What is the difference between EMF and terminal voltage?

Why does terminal voltage decrease when current is drawn?

Explain what would happen to terminal voltage if internal resistance increases.

10. Numerical Practice

A battery of EMF 6 V and internal resistance 1 Ω is connected to an external resistor of 5 Ω. Calculate current and terminal voltage.

The EMF of a cell is 1.5 V. When a current of 0.3 A flows, the terminal voltage is 1.2 V. Find internal resistance.

A cell has internal resistance 0.4 Ω. If it supplies 0.5 A of current and the terminal voltage is 1.9 V, find the EMF.
