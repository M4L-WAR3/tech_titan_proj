The quiz includes a mix of multiple-choice, true/false, and short answer questions.\\n\\nPhysics Quiz: Kinematics\\nPart A: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)\\n\\nChoose the correct option:\\n\\nWhich of the following quantities has both magnitude and direction?\\na) Speed\\nb) Distance\\nc) Displacement\\nd) Time\\nAnswer: c) Displacement\\n\\nIf an object moves with constant velocity, which of the following is true?\\na) Its acceleration is zero\\nb) Its speed is increasing\\nc) It changes direction\\nd) It covers unequal distances in equal intervals of time\\nAnswer: a) Its acceleration is zero\\n\\nA car accelerates from 10 m/s to 30 m/s in 5 seconds. What is its acceleration?\\na) 4 m/s\u00b2\\nb) 5 m/s\u00b2\\nc) 6 m/s\u00b2\\nd) 2 m/s\u00b2\\nAnswer: a) 4 m/s\u00b2\\n(Explanation: a = (v - u)/t = (30 - 10)/5 = 4 m/s\u00b2)\\n\\nThe area under a velocity-time graph represents:\\na) Acceleration\\nb) Distance\\nc) Displacement\\nd) Speed\\nAnswer: c) Displacement\\n\\nA body thrown vertically upwards returns to the same point. Its displacement is:\\na) Zero\\nb) Equal to the distance covered\\nc) Positive\\nd) Equal to height gained\\nAnswer: a) Zero\\n\\nPart B: True or False\\n\\nVelocity is a scalar quantity.\\nAnswer: False\\n\\nThe slope of a distance-time graph gives velocity.\\nAnswer: True\\n\\nNegative acceleration is also called retardation.\\nAnswer: True\\n\\nDisplacement can never be negative.\\nAnswer: False\\n\\nSpeed and velocity always have the same magnitude.\\nAnswer: False\\n\\nPart C: Short Answer Questions\\n\\nDefine acceleration.\\nAnswer: Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time. It is a vector quantity and is given by:\\n\\n\ud835\udc4e\\n=\\n\ud835\udc63\\n\u2212\\n\ud835\udc62\\n\ud835\udc61\\na=\\nt\\nv\u2212u\\n\\t\u200b\\n\\n\\nWhat is the difference between distance and displacement?\\nAnswer:\\n\\nDistance is the total path length traveled by an object, regardless of direction. It is a scalar quantity.\\n\\nDisplacement is the shortest straight-line distance between the initial and final positions of an object, with direction. It is a vector quantity.\\n\\nWhat is uniform motion?\\nAnswer: Uniform motion is the motion of an object in which it covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, regardless of how small those intervals are.\\n\\nGive one example of non-uniform motion.\\nAnswer: A car moving in city traffic with frequent stops and starts is an example of non-uniform motion.\\n\\nAn object is moving in a circular path with constant speed. Is it in uniform motion? Explain.\\nAnswer: No, because even though the speed is constant, the direction of motion changes continuously, so the velocity changes. Hence, the motion is not uniform; it is accelerated motion.\\n\\nWould you like this quiz in a printable format or as an interactive version (like Google Forms)?"]}
