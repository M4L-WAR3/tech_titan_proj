Chapter: Current Electricity, Electrical Energy, and Power
1. Introduction to Current Electricity

Electricity plays a vital role in our daily lives. It powers our homes, industries, and transport systems. In this chapter, we explore the flow of electric charges (current), the energy involved, and how power is consumed in electric circuits.

2. Electric Current
Definition:

Electric current is the flow of electric charge (usually electrons) through a conductor.

Formula:
𝐼
=
𝑄
𝑡
I=tQ​

Where:

𝐼
I = Current (Ampere, A)

𝑄
Q = Charge (Coulomb, C)

𝑡
t = Time (seconds, s)

SI Unit: Ampere (A)

1 Ampere = 1 Coulomb/second

Types of Electric Current:

Direct Current (DC): Flows in one direction. (e.g., from a battery)

Alternating Current (AC): Changes direction periodically. (e.g., from the mains supply)

3. Electric Potential and Potential Difference
Electric Potential:

The work done to bring a unit positive charge from infinity to a point in an electric field.

Potential Difference (Voltage):

The work done in moving a unit charge from one point to another.

Formula:
𝑉
=
𝑊
𝑄
V=QW​

Where:

𝑉
V = Potential Difference (Volt, V)

𝑊
W = Work done (Joule, J)

𝑄
Q = Charge (Coulomb, C)

4. Ohm's Law

Statement:
The current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends, provided the temperature remains constant.

𝑉
∝
𝐼
⇒
𝑉
=
𝐼
𝑅
V∝I⇒V=IR

Where:

𝑉
V = Potential difference (V)

𝐼
I = Current (A)

𝑅
R = Resistance (Ohm, 
Ω
Ω)

Resistance:

The opposition offered by a conductor to the flow of current.

Factors Affecting Resistance:

Length of the conductor (
𝑅
∝
𝐿
R∝L)

Cross-sectional area (
𝑅
∝
1
𝐴
R∝A1​)

Nature of material

Temperature

5. Resistances in Series and Parallel
Series Combination:
𝑅

𝑅
1
+
𝑅
2
+
𝑅
3
+
…
Rtotal​=R1​+R2​+R3​+…

Same current flows through all resistors.

Voltage is divided.

Parallel Combination:

𝑅
2

1
𝑅
3
+
…
Rtotal​1​=R1​1​+R2​1​+R3​1​+…

Voltage remains the same.

Current is divided.

6. Heating Effect of Current (Joule’s Law)

When current flows through a resistor, electrical energy is converted into heat.

Formula:
𝐻
=
𝐼
2
𝑅
𝑡
H=I2Rt

Where:

𝐻
H = Heat produced (Joules)

𝐼
I = Current (A)

𝑅
R = Resistance (Ohms)

𝑡
t = Time (s)

Applications:

Electric heaters

Fuses

Electric bulbs
