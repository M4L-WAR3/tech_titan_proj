Here's a simple and detailed explanation to help with the doubt:\\n\\nQuestion: What is 1 + 1?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n\\nThe question \\\"What is 1 + 1?\\\" is asking us to add two numbers together.\\n\\nLet\u2019s break it down:\\n\\nThe number 1 means you have one thing.\\n\\nIf you add another 1, that means you have one more thing.\\n\\nNow imagine this with objects, like apples:\\n\\n\ud83c\udf4e + \ud83c\udf4e = \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\\n\\nIf you have 1 apple and you add 1 more apple, you will have 2 apples in total.\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 1 + 1 = 2\\n\\nThis is one of the first and most basic math facts, and it\u2019s an example of addition \u2014 which means putting things together to find out how many you have in total.\\n\\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to see it using fingers, pictures, or with a different example!"]}
